# ACI Best Practices eBook

ACI is a modern, powerful, and fully programmable data center
fabric. With almost 10 years in production and thousands upon
thousands of deployments, there is a lot that can be achieved.
For IT Operations Teams, the power of ACI also brings with it an
evolution of the processes to design, configure, migrate and
troubleshoot.

This e-book is your treasure map to information on various
aspects of operating ACI. Its intent is to help you make the
most out of your investment in ACI as a solution, avoid
common mistakes, and collect various tips and tricks from
lessons learned by others.

With anything that dares to call itself “Best Practices” we should
also make it clear that the information contained within attempts
to address the most common designs and situations. We realize
that every customer will have unique requirements that require
sometimes unique solutions. In any case, it is always best to
consult official Cisco documentation and your own Cisco account
team to plan for the best results in your own environment.

The format of this document is organized by major operational
topic. In each topic we will detail the intent and share links to
video playback plus where to download the source content for
your own further use. In addition, and where possible, we will link
and refer you to additional sources that you may find useful.

Each topic is more or less self contained but we present them in
the order which we feel is most useful. It is not always necessary
to know the contents of a previous module before reviewing a
later one.

We assume you have at least introductory level knowledge of ACI
and its operations.
